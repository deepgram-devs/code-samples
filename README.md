# Code Samples

This repository contains a collection of code samples which show how to make common requests to the Deepgram API in various languages.

These code examples do not use the Deepgram SDKs. If you would like to learn more about using Deepgram's SDKs, visit our [Developer Documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/deepgram-sdks).

## Getting Started

Read the README.md file in each language folder to learn how to run the files in that folder.
